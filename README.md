ECE 6100 Project 2: Tomasulo Algorithm Pipelined Processor
=========================

###Project Objectives:
1. To construct a simulator for an out-of-order superscalar processor that uses the Tomasulo algorithm and fetches N instructions per cycle. 
2. Use the simulator to find the appropriate number of function units, fetch rate and result buses for each benchmark. 

###Project Details:
1. The project code is contained in procsim.cpp. This file contains the complete Tomasulo algorithm coded in run_proc() function.
2. Use make file to build the project
3. Tomasulo.py is used to get the appropriate number of function units for given workloads.
